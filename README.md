# IPAUploader
OS X app to manage iOS apps in your HockeyApp account.
First you have to login with your credentials, in order to obtain a token.
Once logged you can get a list of all the apps in your HockeyApp account, with infos about Display Name, Bundle ID, Creation Date and Edit Date for each app.
Then you can also upload an .ipa file in your HockeyApp account: just select the .ipa file, add eventually some release notes and tap the "UPLOAD TO HOCKEYAPP" button: during the uploading you'll see a progress percentage label.
